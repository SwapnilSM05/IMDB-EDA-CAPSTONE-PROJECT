# IMDB-EDA-CAPSTONE-PROJECT
The IMDB data set contains meaningfull insight into the cinema business.
We have the data for the 100 top-rated movies from the past decade along with various pieces of information about the movie, its actors, and the voters who have rated these movies online.
In this assignment, we will try to find some interesting insights into these movies and their voters, using Python.
After briefly going through the IMDB movie dataset, one can start to notice some correlations or trends between various characterstics of the movie. The pertinant business question that any Data Analyst would ask when browsing through this data set is to find out what characterstics of movies produce the highest revenue. This investigation and reaserch would help the film industry to work on those characterstics that would generate the highest revenue and by extension increase the movies popularity

It is due to these above mentioned reasons, that I have decided to keep one major overaching question that would drive the entire investigation and from which other sub-questions and trends would be discovered.

The focus of our investigation would revolve around

"What characterstics and traits of a movie generate higher revenue". Is their a positive correlation between one characterstic and revenue and can one conclude that this correlation might also be defined as causation?

From this other subquestions can be derived and various other trends explored for example:

Does the budget have a direct correlation with the revenue produce. Our normal understanding would be that the higher the investment, the greater the revenue that shall be generated. We shall use the data to either support or disprove this statement.

Do any other characterstics support any other co-relation either positive or negative for high revenue? Our further exploratory analyis would lead us to ask more questions. The other significatiant investigation we shall be doing is understanding trends within the dataset independent of one another to come to conclusions. Whether certain trends show a decline in a particular characterstic or help increase it.
